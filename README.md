# Rail Map Painter

Design your own rail map by freely dragging stations from different cities and connecting them with 45 degree rounded corner or perpendicular lines!

We currently support stations and miscellaneous elements from following cities:

* Shanghai (except Maglev and Jinshan Railway)
* Guangzhou (except facilities icons and perfect interchange station)
* Beijing (only interchange station)

Make your own rail map on the [GitHub mirror](https://railmapgen.github.io/rmp/) or get the latest offline desktop application at the [release page](https://github.com/railmapgen/rmp/releases).
